## JIRA with Nexmo SMS

## Introduction

JIRA with Nexmo SMS add-on enables JIRA to send SMS notifications to JIRA users (issue assignee and reporter) when a new issue is assigned, resolved or reopened.

-   Issue assigned

    -   Hi &lt;assignee\_name&gt;, a new &lt;IssueType&gt; &lt;IssueName&gt; is assigned to you, reported by &lt;reporter name&gt;.

-   Issue resolved

    -   Hi &lt;reporter\_name&gt;, the &lt;IssueType&gt; &lt;IssueName&gt; reported by you is resolved by &lt;assignee name&gt;.

-   Issue reopened

    -   Hi &lt;assignee\_name&gt;, the &lt;IssueType&gt;Â &lt;IssueName&gt; is reopened and assigned to you by &lt;reporter name&gt;.
